Hello and welcome to our tweet-based search engine. This project was created as a final project for the Information Retrieval course and focused on retrieving covid related tweets.

This search engine built with Python, using open source tools such as NLTK. https://www.nltk.org/

This engine is trained and based on 2GB (about 10M) data of tweets.

The engine is reading, parsing, indexing, and ranking those tweets and different queries from the user or from a pre-made queries list.

Our parser specializes in entity identification, prefix correction, and covid related orientation.

Also, our search engine support query expansion using 2 different technics such as

1. WordNet - https://wordnet.princeton.edu/
2. Thesaurus - For semantic words appending

The search engine is using PyPI SpellChecker and Levenshtein Distance to find and correct misspell.

You are all welcome to visit our search engine website that we've created.
